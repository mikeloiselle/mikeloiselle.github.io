    <H1 >Welcome to Michael Joseph James' Portfolio</H1>
    <div id="main">Welcome to the personal website of Michael Joseph James. I am a self-employed Web Developer looking for a permanent position in the industry. Previously, I worked in the Electrical field, but a car accident in 2018 required that I switch careers. </br></br> Attending Fanshawe College in London, Ontario has provided me with all the necessary skills to be successful in the industry. Through schooling and self-learning, I have experience in front end technologies such as CSS, React and Javascript; as well as back-end technologies including Node.JS, C# and PHP. I also have experience working with Dev-ops technologies for LAMP and WAMP. </br> After graduating from Fanshawe with Honours, I briefly attended Centennial College online for video game design. Already being familiar with how to do programming, I was able to transfer immediately into second year. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic and childcare responsibilities, I was unable to complete the course. However, I gained further knowledge in the fields of Java, Object-Oriented Programming and Digital Art. </br></br> Please take a moment to check out my projects tab on this website to see examples of what I am capable of as a programmer. I have also included some videolinks to different projects I have completed. Thank you for taking the time to read my profile.</div>
